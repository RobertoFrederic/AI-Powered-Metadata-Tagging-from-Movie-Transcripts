Based on the graphic novel "2 Guns"

FADE IN:

INT. TRES CRUCES SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

[00:01:23] BOBBY TRENCH (30s, undercover DEA agent) and STIG STIGMAN (20s, undercover Navy intelligence) sit across from each other at a small table. The bank bustles around them.

BOBBY
(checking his watch)
You nervous about this?

STIG
Me? Nervous? I eat danger for breakfast, partner.

BOBBY
Right. Just remember - we're here for Papi Greco's money, not to make friends.

[00:02:45] PAPI GRECO (50s, dangerous cartel leader) enters the bank with his entourage. Gold chains, expensive suit, the works.

PAPI GRECO
(to his men in Spanish)
Secure the perimeter. Nobody gets in or out.

[00:03:12] STIG whispers to BOBBY.

STIG
There's our target. Forty-three million in drug money, locked away in safety deposit boxes.

BOBBY
According to our intelligence, yes. Question is - can we trust each other?

[00:04:30] The bank alarm suddenly BLARES. Red lights flash.

BANK MANAGER
(over intercom)
This is not a drill. Please remain calm and follow security protocols.

[00:05:15] BOBBY and STIG exchange glances. This wasn't part of the plan.

BOBBY
(into his hidden wire)
Control, we have a situation. Bank is going into lockdown.

STIG
(pulling out his gun)
Plans change, partner. We adapt or we die.

CUT TO:

EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

[00:06:00] FBI vehicles surround the building. AGENT DIME (40s, Bobby's handler) coordinates from a command vehicle.

AGENT DIME
(into radio)
All units, hold position. We have two assets inside - maintain visual contact.

FADE OUT.
